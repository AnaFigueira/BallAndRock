Ball and Rock

The game is played with the mobile phone in portrait mode. The game should have a ball that rolls on a flat surface (the bottom of the screen). If the player rotates his phone to the left or right, the ball must move accordingly simulating the gravity pull. Also, the ball movement should take into account acceleration and deceleration. So, if I rotate the phone to the right and the ball starts rolling to the right, if I then rotate to the left, the ball moving speed should decrease until it stops and just then should it start to roll to the left at an increasing speed.

The edges of the screen serve as walls with which the ball collides.  

At the same time, rocks are falling from the top to the bottom of the screen with random X coordinates. The rocks are immune to the gravity pull and, as such, keep a constant X coordinate throughout their fall.

If the stones and the ball collide, the player loses.
